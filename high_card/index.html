                <li>Each round is played where the player and CPU select one card (CPU card is random) and the person with the highest value wins the round.</li>
                <li>Both players can only play a card one time per complete game. Once a round is over, the card will be removed from the player's respective hands.</li>
                <li>Once you play your card, whoever has the higher value will get a point above the player box, and to go to the next round, click on the "Start Next Round" Button.</li>
                <li>If you want to reset to play a fresh game, hit the "Reset Game" button.</li>
